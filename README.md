# HyperMind
In a cross between Worms clone and Roguelike, you enter a dreamlike world of abstractions, constructing mental tools to explore - and alter - the mind.

# Requirements
LÃ¶ve2D 0.10.2 or compatible

# How to Build

1. Update whatever .lua files.

2. Run package.sh

3. Optionally, rename the new .backup file to save it.


# Pro-tips

* Configure your controls in Properties.lua

* If you change the level generating bits, you should probably delete the existing level cache. On Linux, this is ~/.local/share/love/HyperMind/levels/*.png

* Holy hell do not look at the source, though. It is currently very atrocious; I make no excuse.
